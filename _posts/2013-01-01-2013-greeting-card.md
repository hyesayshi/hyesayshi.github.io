A traditional optical illusion technique meets coding, animation, and experimental typography.

Thinking about the flood of new technologies in animation/design, and the vast possibilities of using these technologies together to create something new, we instead went back to an optical illusion technique that enabled us to create 8-frame animation cycle only using traditional mediums â€“ paper and transparency film. This does not need any special devices/techniques to view animation other than the card itself.

Adobe Illustrator, After Effects and Processing were used to aid the process, and quickly realize the ideas.
